## <a id="2-1-0"></a> v2.1.0

**Release Date**: MMMM DD, 2020

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* Adds security metadata for `CREATE` and `CHMOD` events on Linux.
For more information, see [Metadata](./installing.html#metadata).

* Adds support for an in&#8209;memory cache on Linux to store security metadata for files.
If you enable this feature, <%= vars.product_abbr %> uses more memory, but reduces the number of trivial file
events that are logged.
For more information, see [In-Memory Cache](./installing.html#in-memory-cache).

### Known Issues

This release has the following known issue:

* `user` and `group` security metadata might not be accurate for files in containers on
<%= vars.app_runtime_first %> and <%= vars.k8s_runtime_full %>
(<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>).
However, you can determine the correct username and group name for a file from the `uid` and `gid` metadata keys.
For more information, see [Metadata](./installing.html#metadata).
